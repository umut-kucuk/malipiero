# Abstract
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in preserving and making accessible the works of important historical figures. In the field of music, this has led to the creation of digital libraries of the works of composers such as Beethoven and Mozart.

Gian Francesco Malipiero was an Italian composer who was born in Venice in 1882. Over the course of his long and distinguished career, he wrote more than 300 works, including operas, symphonies, and piano concertos. He was a leading figure in the development of Italian music in the 20th century and his music continues to be performed and celebrated to this day.

This study proposes to create a digital library of the works of Malipiero, including not only his musical compositions, but also his letters, photographs, and other materials. The library will be made accessible via a web-based visualization built using the Observable platform, which allows users to easily explore and interact with the library's resources.
