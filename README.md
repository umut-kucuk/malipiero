Malipiero Project
This thesis is an exploration and analysis of the collected works of Gian Francesco Malipiero, a composer and musicologist from the early 20th century. The thesis aims to create a digital library with all of Malipiero’s works, ranging from musical works and letters, to photos and movies. 

The digital library will be accessible through a visualization created in Observable, a web-based platform for data visualization. The first part of the thesis will involve researching and collecting Malipiero’s works, both online and in physical, non-digital formats. 

Part two will focus on organizing and cataloging the collected works in a digital library. The library will be coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and will be based on the Data Visualization Library provided by D3.js. The last part of the thesis will involve creating a visualization of the digital library in Observable. This will include creating an interactive user interface that will allow users to access the library’s contents.
